This example demonstrates a common error in PHP related to its loose typing system.  When performing arithmetic operations, PHP will automatically type juggle.  However, if one operand is a string, it may lead to unexpected string concatenation instead of mathematical addition. The bug.php file contains the erroneous code. The bugSolution.php file provides a corrected version.  Always validate the data types to avoid this issue.
